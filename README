  <leader>zax  Align all folds of level 'x'  
  <leader>zox  Insert a start foldmarker of level 'x' at the end of line  
  <leader>zcx  Insert an end  foldmarker of level 'x' at the end of line  
  <leader>zOx  Insert a start foldmarker of level 'x' enclosed in comments at the end of line  
  <leader>zCx  Insert an end  foldmarker of level 'x' enclosed in comments at the end of line  
  <leader>zd   Delete a foldmarker present on the line  

  <leader>zaa  Align all the folds
  <leader>zoo  Insert an unnumbered open foldmarker
  <leader>zcc  Insert an unnumbered close foldmarker
  <leader>zOO  Insert a commented unnumbered open foldmarker
  <leader>zCC  Insert a commented unnumbered close foldmarker

where 'x' is a number from 0-9. 0 refers to unnumbered folds
